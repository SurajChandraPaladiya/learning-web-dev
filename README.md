# Learning Web Development ðŸš€

Welcome to my web development learning journey!  
This repository is a collection of projects and mini-experiments Iâ€™m building as I learn and grow from **frontend basics** to **advanced web development** and eventually **backend and full-stack development**.

## ðŸ“Œ What You'll Find Here

- **HTML & CSS Projects**  
  Simple layouts, responsive designs, and styling experiments.

- **JavaScript Projects**  
  DOM manipulation, interactive web elements, small JS apps.

- **React Projects (Coming Soon)**  
  Building dynamic, component-based web applications.

- **Backend Projects (Future Goal)**  
  Once Iâ€™m confident with frontend, Iâ€™ll start learning backend technologies like Node.js, Express, etc.
